  Creating machine made hats was not my initial intention when I first looked into
knitting about a year or so ago. I was interested in starting knitting almost a decade
prior, however, procrastinated and never got rolling with it until after heart surgery
and a visit to Iceland for a music festival (Airwaves) in 2015. After speaking with a gardening
client this spring while working for Black Birch Landscaping Co, about the Icelandic
sweater I was knitting, she mentioned I could have her knitting machines, yes plural,
because she was moving and hadn't used them in years. \\

  And so, many mistakes and setup issues like replacing the sponge bar stalled the process of creating
a swatch which is pivotal to determining the outcome of a project whether it be a hat, blanket
or whatever. My latest hat is two color.\\
  It is my only two color hat and is actually designed to fold back almost like a smurf or rasta 
hat. Because it turned out too tight, I reinforced the seam in the back and folded the extra length of
the hat back. It has since slackened a bit and I've grown fond of it. A minor repair in the back top part
is needed, but nothing a few minutes of sewing can't fix.\\
  The top title picture are hats made following YouTube instruction videos by Roberta Rose Kelley on her bulky 
machine. I am experimenting every time I begin a hat with yarn types and often resort back to 2 ply cotton
yarn simply because it works best with the machine I use, the Studio 360.\\
