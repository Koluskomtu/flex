## Singles

This article is under contstruction.
 
 Update: 2017-01-24 The Stem Mastering process is in the works for 2 singles due for delivery 
 to a Mastering Engineer Christopher Dion out of Montreal, QC. I'll be holding off on pressing
 vinyl right away although that is the purpose of the final mastering. I found Christopher via 
 SoundBetter.com out of Brookline, MA and was impressed by his schooling as well as his studio setup at
  ![Quantum Msuic Mastering](http://www.quantum-music.ca/) . 

The two singles, Seize and Superbike will either be Stem mastered at the highest sample rate I can 
go and divided into 8 or so audio groups separating out the kick, snare, bass, synth, guitars, etc. 
In order to distribute my work I will need to create a distribution service starting as a DBA and
hopefully going into another type of business form i.e. LLC. 

Right now I'm looking at ![Gotta Groove Records](http://www.gottagrooverecords.com/) out of Cleveland, OH because of their quality and passion 
along with the ability to press in small numbers. The records will partially be for promotional use 
in order to score a licensing deal and perhaps generate income in order to produce more vinyl remixes 
in the near future as well as provide funding for a potential video game application that is centered
around virtual 3d records. I will not be able to do this alone and will need feedback as well as community 
involvement. 

The cover will hopefullly include an image of David Flores artwork of a superbike. Before, pressing I will
be approaching him via e-mail again to see if I can obtain permissions with a set fee or contract a portion 
of sales.
