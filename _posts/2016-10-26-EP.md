## Follow my EP scheduled for an early 2017 release.

Johngo is setting deadlines for completing finished songs from a series of past soundcloud grooves. One of which will be Seize and 3 other yet to be announced songs in groove stage. Most of these tunes are fleshed out and the recording parts I've elected to approach with spontaneity over the next few months.
