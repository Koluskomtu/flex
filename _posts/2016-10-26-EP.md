## Follow my EP scheduled for an early 2017 release.

Johngo is setting deadlines for completing finished songs from a series of past soundcloud grooves. One of which will be [Seize](https://soundcloud.com/koluskomtu/seize4soundcheck4) and 3 other yet to be announced songs. Most of these tunes are fleshed out and the recording parts I've elected to approach with spontaneity over the next few months. Nothing earth-shattering. One thing to note this is an instrumental album.
