## Follow my EP scheduled for an early 2017 release.

Johngo is setting deadlines for completing songs from a series of past soundcloud grooves. One of which will be an unfinished
work codenamed Seize  and 3 other songs. Most of these tunes are fleshed out and the recording parts I've elected to approach with spontaneity over the next few months. Nothing earth-shattering. One thing to note this is an instrumental album. 

Here is a current heavy guitar version of Seize. There are several other recordings some of which have a more clean sound. I may release a single or two and adapt parts for a live set. Stay tuned.
