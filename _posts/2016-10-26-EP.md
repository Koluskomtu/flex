## Follow my EP scheduled for an early 2017 release.

Johngo is setting deadlines for completing songs from a series of past soundcloud grooves fpr a 2017 release of an EP codenamed Blue Forest. One of works alternately called Seize  and 3 other songs. Most of these tunes are fleshed out but currently are wanting for development. Nothing earth-shattering. 

Here is a current heavy guitar version of Seize. There are several other recordings some of which have a more clean sound. I may release a single or two and adapt parts for a live set. Stay tuned.
