I primarily use Soundcloud as an audio reference and to hopefully get constructive feedback as to the EQ of a particular track. Now that this blog is fully operational, I am seeing my use of Soundcloud has been squandered and could provide a forum for listeners to follow my audio projects as they get more professionally produced. As, of right now, I feel they are mediocre, even certain songs that I find well done often times after several listens leave something to be desired. 

And so, Thelonius is a short dub step groove that is influenced by Thelonius Monk, the infamous Jazz pianist. For this particular groove, my approach is to make the piano parts the main focus for rhythmic patterns and the resolving to the tonic chord structure slightly offsetting. Albeit this is not a very ground breaking angle for songwriting, I'm having fun with it.
