## 3d Records in Engine. Why should you Care?


This article is in progress, [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/blog) is the curent engine
the prototype 3drecord is imported into. 

The following 2 images are from Blender 3d. They were early on influential into my decision to try importing turntables into Unreal Engine. The Technics turntable is a rendering of a download. I did buy a 3d model of a technics turntable from Turbo Squid. The record is actually a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/WpOPkYby3rI) for blender by a South African gentleman. I intend to release all of my remixes and songs in a 3d game Engine with a possible Indiegogo or Kickstarter begging campaign to release certain works onto Vinyl.
