## 3d Records in Engine. Why should you Care?

This article is in progress, [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/blog) is the curent engine
the prototype 3drecord is imported into and I am willing if the right talent comes on board to work with CryEngine
if the work flow begins is more efficent. A technics turntable from Autodesk downloaded from turbo squid is the player
and the lighting booth has yet to be built.

still working on this article. it is just a link test at the moment.
