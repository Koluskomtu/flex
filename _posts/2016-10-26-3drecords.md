## 3d Records in Engine. Why should you Care?


This article is in progress, [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/blog) is the curent engine
the prototype 3drecord is imported into. still working on this article. it is just a link test at the moment. 

The following 2 images are from Blender 3d. They were early on influential into my decision to try importing turntables into Unreal Engine. The Technics turntable is a rendering of a download. I did buy a 3d model of a technics turntable from Turbo Squid. The record is actually a tutorial for blender by a South African gentleman. As soon as I refind the link I will post it. The tutorial is for Blender and the dimensions are to scale for a real record.
